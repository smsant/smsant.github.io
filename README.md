Hello! I am a third-year PhD student in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon, advised by Travis Breaux.​ 

I am broadly interested in the societal factors of software development and the linguistic phenomena of software artifacts. My work focuses on reasoning about legal aspects of software and on collaboration interfaces between lawyers, engineers, and large-language models. In addition to research, I care deeply about my teaching efforts in K-12 STEM tutoring and computer science pedagogy.

In a past life, I worked with lawyers and economists on quantitative fraud investigations at Berkeley Research Group. ​I have a B.S. from Georgetown University, where I majored in Science, Technology, and International Affairs, and a master's in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania's MCIT program.
